UFP Identity PingFederate IdP Adapter

To build this using the standard PingFederate SDK, you can clone this repository under <pf_home>/sdk/plugin-src
create a lib directory and copy the latest identity4j .jar into the lib directory.

When creating the IdP adapter in the PingFederate admin, currently the only option is to set the keystore password.
